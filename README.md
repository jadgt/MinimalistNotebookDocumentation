# Privacy Policy for Minimalist Notebook

_Last updated: [September 25th, 2025]_

Minimalist Notebook (“the App”) is designed to protect your privacy.  
This policy explains what data is (and is not) collected, stored, and shared.

---

## 1. Information We Do **Not** Collect

- **No personal data**  
  We do not ask for your name, email address, or any other personal information.

- **No analytics or tracking**  
  The App contains no third-party analytics, advertising frameworks, or hidden tracking tools.

- **No cloud storage**  
  Notes and images are **never** uploaded to external servers.

---

## 2. Information Stored on Your Device

- **Notes and images**  
  All text, photos, and attachments you create are stored **locally on your iPhone or iPad** in the app’s private Documents directory.

- **App settings**  
  Simple preferences such as your last-used date are stored in Apple’s **UserDefaults**, which remain on your device.

This data remains under your control and is included only if you choose to back up your device (e.g., iCloud Backup or encrypted iTunes/Finder backup).

---

## 3. Optional iCloud / Device Backups

If you enable Apple’s system-wide backups (iCloud Backup or encrypted computer backups), your notes and images may be included in those backups.  
Apple’s handling of that data is governed by **Apple’s Privacy Policy**, not this app.

---

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We never share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone.  
You may choose to export or share your own notes or images; that action is entirely under your control.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

---

## 6. Security

Because all information stays on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device and any backups you create.  
We recommend using a device passcode and, if desired, Apple’s built-in encryption.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last updated” date and publish the revised policy on our support website.

---

## 8. Contact

If you have questions or concerns about privacy or this policy, please contact:

**Email:** juan.degracia@icloud.com

Minimalist Notebook is built with privacy as a core principle:  
**your notes never leave your device unless you choose to share them.**
